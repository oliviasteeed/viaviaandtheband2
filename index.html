                                I wrote it when I was 20-21 and think it conveys the existential rollercoaster of being young, and figuring out who you are. I am still no closer to figuring that out, but I realize that might just be the reality of being alive? <br><br>
                                
                                It’s a very personal, very honest reflection of my experiences, emotions and thoughts. Welcome to my brain that always says no matter what you are doing, what you have, what you have accomplished, or who you are, it’s never enough. <br><br>

                            <p class="song-comment">This song is the first we recorded, so it has kind of a special
                                place
                                in
                                my
                                heart. I wrote it in early September 2022 after I asked a guy I liked out and he said
                                no.
                                Whenever I
                                develop feelings for someone I see myself fading away, replaced by whoever I think they
                                want
                                me
                                to
                                be, and it’s an isolating feeling when it doesn't even work and you’re left to figure
                                out
                                who
                                you
                                are again. Belonging to yourself is a gift and a curse, and giving yourself to someone
                                else
                                is
                                the
                                biggest risk you can take, and yet I’m still a hopeless romantic. They say it’s worth
                                it.

                                    what the hell happened last night?<br>
                                    did I dream of you again?<br>
                                    what am I trying to tell me<br>
                                    guess it’s never innocent<br>
                                    <br>

                                    but it comes right at the end<br>
                                    guess that I’m too late again<br>
                                    I’m sure you’re taken anyways<br>
                                    too bad I’m too uptight for this<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I just want to have it all<br>
                                    but as soon as it’s enough<br>
                                    it’s not<br>
                                    cause I get caught up on someone I should ignore<br>
                                    oh I get caught before it starts<br>
                                    <br>

                                    what’s another chance I’ve watched?<br>
                                    don’t even know you that much <br>
                                    but if I could do it over<br>
                                    I’d say hi right from the start<br>
                                    <br>

                                    but you only get one shot<br>
                                    so for now it’s all there is for me<br>
                                    dreaming of my eye candy<br>
                                    you’re losing me my dignity<br>
                                    <br>

                                    how do my insides make you everything?<br>
                                    as soon as I have time, it’s on<br>
                                    I don’t pretend to understand<br>
                                    I swear last week you weren’t this hot<br>
                                    <br>

                                    it’s not a dream<br>
                                    it’s not the truth<br>
                                    it’s a bad idea<br>
                                    to believe in you<br>
                                    I want it all <br>
                                    I want it gone<br>
                                    you’re just another stupid song<br>
                                </p>

                                    I'm addicted to the way you touch my soul<br>
                                    and I don't really know what else to say<br>
                                    but I want you around me every day<br>

                                    it's not a sunrise without me and you and you and I<br>
                                    and it's not a worthy day when you don't call my name<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I don't even try anymore<br>

                                    cause right now this is all I've ever wanted<br>

                                    and when you're not around I lose my mind<br>

                            <p class="song-comment">I came up with the chorus for this one on the day before my 21st birthday after crying during family dinner. I've noticed a trend where I have goals I think will fix me or make me happy and I only enjoy the pursuit, but once I have something I just move on to the next target. What I have achieved is never quite enough. xOlivia

                                    consciousness is a problem I just can't solve<br>
                                    I'm too devout to attention<br>

The thing I love about songwriting is you can fully embody and exaggerate an emotion or experience and turn it into something that you're proud of and let those feelings go. This is one of the only songs I play guitar on. After making the original demo together, I spent the night letting some thing out by adding all the guitar part layering and screaming vocals (so much that we can't even play this song in Reaper without it crashing). xOlivia

                                    now I'm wasting my time again<br>
                                    for a chance to see you and<br>
                                    it works just like I imagined it<br>
                                    like it never did<br>
                                    <br>

                                    talk to you all night<br>
                                    take the late train home with me<br>
                                    even though it's longer for you<br>
                                    you're just that damn sweet<br>
                                    <br>

                                    like I've been in a cage but you've opened it<br>
                                    like I'm here in the world again<br>
                                    pretty please<br>
                                    you remind me how it feels to breathe<br>
                                    what a feeling to feel something<br>
                                    but of course<br>
                                    <br>

                                    you better get home to her<br>
                                    and here I was thinking it was my turn<br>

                                    call myself an adult<br>
                                    but I'm still so naive<br>

                                    <br>

                                    I guess it's my destiny<br>
                                    to be friends with guys perfect for me<br>
                                    I mean you're favourite class<br>

                            <p class="song-comment">This is the oldest song on the album (October 2022) from a semester in university when I was in a course that deeply impacted my confidence and self-concept, while feeling very alone and mentally unwell. All I did was work on my courses in my bedroom and it began to feel like I was already essentially dead to the world because I didn't exist in it. xOlivia

                                    I've got so many plants in my room<br>
                                    maybe one day they'll grow me too<br>
                                    painted my walls in pale blue<br>
                                    so they look just like the sky used to<br>
                                    <br>

                                    when there's sun I go outside<br>
                                    thinking about my past lives<br>
                                    when it's noon I guess I'll eat<br>
                                    so my lungs can breathe and heart can beat<br>
                                    <br>

                                    shower brush and go to bed<br>
                                    don't have the time for this but then<br>
                                    wake up do it all again<br>
                                    reason's lost along the bend<br>
                                    <br>

                                    wishing it away<br>
                                    but there's nothing to wish for<br>
                                    here it is<br>
                                    I wish somebody told me<br>
                                    that this life is all there is<br>
                                    <br>

                                    wake up now before the sun<br>
                                    worried cheeks I'm chewing on<br>
                                    watch me fall as I perform<br>
                                    is this what I'm still here for?<br>
                                    <br>

                                    wake up from a dream I had<br>
                                    star filled cities in the sand<br>
                                    bombs that burn right through my hands<br>
                                    where I held the love I used to have<br>
                                </p>

                            <p class="song-comment">My closest friend went through some mental health struggles that ultimately ended our friendship and left me unable to trust or be vulnerable with peers. After years of social isolation, I tried to be social again, but trying to connect with others either left me feeling empty, or reminded me of her and made me want to retreat into myself again. Feeling pain means you are truly living, so I keep trying. xOlivia

                                    I remember you fondly<br>
                                    the path at the end of the concrete<br>
                                    I remember you laughing<br>
                                    I remember the safety<br>
                                    I felt<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I remember you'd choose me<br>
                                    I never thought I would lose it<br>
                                    I was a little bit naive<br>
                                    but I remember you fondly<br>
                                    I do<br>
                                    <br>

                                    and I try I try I do<br>
                                    to meet someone somewhere new<br>
                                    I force myself out of the house<br>
                                    like I couldn't do for you<br>
                                    <br>

                                    oh I try it's trying for me<br>
                                    and come home worse than I leave<br>
                                    I spent it all on nothing<br>
                                    nothing to show for it<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I miss it and it's all I want to do<br>
                                    I want it<br>
                                    but I can't love someone new<br>
                                    they just remind me of you<br>
                                    they just remind me of you<br>

                                    late night voices soften<br>
                                    I remember your secrets<br>
                                    why didn't I see it?<br>
                                    see through<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I remember us fighting<br>
                                    I remember you lying<br>
                                    I remember you leaving<br>
                                    cause I was a little too honest<br>
                                    for you<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I think you're lost<br>
                                    you ask me why<br>

                                    that we don't know<br>
                                    you probably knew that three years ago<br>

                                    I guess it's true<br>
                                    you've grown on me<br>

                                    it blows my mind<br>

                                    you know the world<br>
                                    I've read about<br>
                                    but I'm the calm one<br>
                                    and you're in doubt<br>

                                    you're kind of dumb<br>

                                    and I'm uptight<br>
                                    and kind of rude<br>

                            <p class="song-comment">This is the best song on the album in my opinion. It's the other song I play guitar on, because again I had some things to let out. My brother and I were both heartbroken and romantically frustrated at the same time and I pulled out this song I has written a couple months prior and we just let it all out. I'm pretty sure Elliot broke his drumsticks. It was amazing. xOlivia

                            <p class="song-comment">I realized this past Summer that I am obsessed with the sun, and the sense of peace I get when the sun's warmth is on my skin, like the world is holding me. I also realized I have a profound appreciation for nature. I ended up writing about all of this through the lens of my relationship with my mom, who embodies the peace, and strength of nature and is a ray of sun in my life. xOlivia

                                    your skies of blue<br>
                                    say there's a reason to be happy<br>
                                    remind me to be happy<br>

                                    there's something in the air tonight<br>
                                    I don't know what to call it<br>
                                    lifetime of waiting in the wings<br>
                                    I’m tired of waiting for it<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I said I'd never change my mind<br>
                                    but here I am a traitor<br>
                                    life was a dusty bank back then<br>
                                    now it's a roaring river<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I'm tired of being a housewife<br>
                                    I want to come home late now<br>
                                    I used to always want to drive<br>
                                    each day I take the train now<br>
                                    <br>

                                    used to be slave to superficial<br>
                                    but now I don't wear makeup<br>
                                    I used to call me antisocial<br>
                                    but now I always go out<br>
                                    <br>

                                    isn't it funny<br>
                                    when you're not who you used to be?<br>
                                    isn't it funny<br>
                                    when you realize you're doing it?<br>
                                    isn't it funny<br>
                                    when you're not who you used to be?<br>
                                    isn't it funny<br>
                                    when you grow out of misery<br>
                                    <br>

                                    maybe I was late to the party<br>
                                    maybe I was late<br>
                                    maybe I was late to the party<br>
                                    maybe I was late<br>
                                    maybe I was late to the party<br>

                                    maybe I was late to the party<br>
                                    but I got here anyways<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I'm tired of living in denial<br>
                                    I want to fall in love now<br>
                                    here is my grown up honesty<br>
                                    I know that I'm enough now<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I can do something by myself<br>
                                    and I can disagree now too<br>
                                    I can go where the night takes me<br>
                                    instead of rushing home to you<br>
                                </p>

                            <p class="band-comment">We’re siblings from BC that like to make songs on the weekends. I
                                (Olivia) have a
                                lot to ~express~ so write a lot of songs to figure out what I feel over different
                                combinations of the only 6 chords I know (thank god for the capo). Elliot (my
                                brother) just so happens to play guitar, bass, drums, kazoo (and he just rips it)
                                and some piano, but can’t write a song to save his life. When I turned 21 I decided
                                to not be insecure anymore, because as an Adult I can just do that, and we started
                                recording songs I had written over the past year. This is the result, a collection
                                of songs written from September 2022 to August 2023 about growing up, becoming a
                                self and learning to exist in the world again.
