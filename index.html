                                I wrote this one about my relationship with my mom, but sung it months later in a fever
                                dream minute where I was considering getting back together with my ex. Elliot says it
                                sounds
                                like a 2000s teen movie credits song and I tend to agree.

                                Elliot calls this one a 'platonic lovesong' which is essentially right. It's about

                            i could dress up<br>
                            make myself into your dream girl<br>

                            will you wake up<br>
                            i'm not good enough?<br>
                            is it settling?<br>
                            wasn't looking for you<br>
                            but damn you're something<br>
                            <br>
                            cause i can't remember life before<br>
                            you asked me why and why again<br>
                            i don't like wasting time<br>
                            but with you i wish the days would never end<br>
                            <br>
                            gotta sit down<br>
                            for the texts i sent<br>
                            you're just crazy enough<br>
                            to kind of get it<br>
                            in the front of my mind<br>
                            what if you're not right?<br>
                            but the worse thought<br>
                            is what if you are?<br>
                            <br>
                            i could be cool<br>
                            i could be fun<br>
                            show me off like a prize that you won<br>
                            <br>
                            i could be romantic<br>
                            pull you into the rain<br>
                            not feel sick when i'm kissing your face<br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            i could be happy<br>
                            i could fall in love<br>
                            as soon as i stop thinking so much <br>
                            <br>
                            but i don't want to tell my friends<br>
                            don't want you to meet my parents<br>
                            cause this is outside of me<br>
                            she's a new person i've never been<br>

                            <br>
                            why is feeling seen is so embarassing?<br>
                            look at you, i'm already ashamed<br>
                            cause what if you saw what i thought?<br>
                            but you already know me like i'm see through<br>
                            <br>
                            and I tried <br>
                            to cut you off, here we are<br>
                            sitting beside you entertaining this<br>
                            cause i like how it feels to hold hands<br>
                            i like how it feels to casually touch you<br>
                            i like how you make the plans<br>
                            i like how you text me back<br>
                            i like how you think my thoughts<br>
                            i like how it feels to be wanted <br>
                            wish i liked how it feels to want<br>
                            <br>
                            i can't let go yet <br>
                            know i overthought <br>
                            it's just that you're not what i thought i would want<br>
                            <br>
                            hold on a bit longer<br>
                            can we just pretend?<br>
                            look the other way<br>
                            while delaying the end

                            This song is essentially the thesis statement of the album: I want to be close
                            to people but I am afraid of being close to people and I also don't know how. I wrote this
                            one after becoming someone's girlfriend and realizing I had no idea how to play the role of
                            girlfriend.

                        <p class="about-lyrics">
                            This is a cover of Desire, one of my favourite songs from legendary band, and
                            masters of
                            reverb, Cannons. A mix of their songs autoplayed on YouTube after some Metric songs
                            while I
                            was at work, and from the first song, let me tell you, I was TRANSFIXED. I remember
                            just
                            walking around downtown listening to the rest of the mix before going home like
                            “WOW”,
                            esentially with my mouth agape. I tried playing Desire on guitar and just played it
                            heavier
                            and heavier until I was screaming. I recorded the demo in an hour maybe and brought
                            it to
                            Elliot immediately to record. From a singer perspective, this was an experiment in
                            'sounding
                            sexy,' because the lyrics are more forward than I am comfortable being or writing. I
                            didn't
                            anticipate doing covers since I always have so much to write, but it's fun to
                            inhabit a
                            different persona and make it your own, which I think we more than achieved with
                            this song.
                            Seriously, listen to the original to compare (or just stop there since it's a
                            masterpiece).
                            Cannons captures the subtle push and pull of attraction, and I think we nail the
                            anguish of
                            unrequited desire.

                            we say it's surreal<br>
                            cause the truth is not here<br>
                            <br>
                            but you are<br>
                            <br>
                            nothing but sweetness<br>
                            innocent youth<br>
                            i think i'm a little old for you<br>
                            <br>
                            look in my eyes<br>
                            with a word on your tongue<br>
                            but i don't want you to say it<br>
                            cause you're not the one<br>
                            <br>
                            i can't believe i have you all to myself<br>
                            i can't believe that's not enough for this girl<br>
                            <br>
                            i've never met someone like you<br>
                            i like that you tell me all your secrets<br>
                            but after you read me your old notes<br>
                            i kind of wish i stayed ignorant<br>
                            <br>
                            and you want all the answers too<br>
                            but aside from thoughts do you actually feel it? <br>
                            you're out turning your life into business<br>
                            and i belong to the world you rejected<br>
                            <br>
                            in the start i was naive<br>
                            i couldn't believe<br>
                            that you just kept choosing to me<br>
                            but as soon as i felt good enough for you<br>
                            you weren't good enough for me<br>
                            <br>
                            we say it's surreal<br>
                            cause the future's not here<br>
                            <br>
                            but you are<br>
                            <br>
                            nothing but sweetness<br>

                            This is the breakup song. I wrote it over a weekend while walking around Mayne
                            Island
                            agonizing, and then I knew I had to break up with him when I came home and sung it
                            with
                            my
                            guitar. You can lie to your friends, family, and yourself, but you can't lie to your
                            guitar.

                        <p class="song-lyrics">i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            cause everything else would be perfect<br>
                            but you can't choose who you attract<br>
                            i wish i wanted it like you did<br>
                            <br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            when i imagine how we could be<br>
                            we'd move out and talk all night<br>
                            you'd make millions, i'd be happy<br>
                            <br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            so now we text everyday<br>
                            more than we did when we were dating<br>
                            but it's no pressure if you don't<br>
                            and now i don't have to fulfill you<br>
                            <br>
                            much better for my anxious avoidance<br>
                            still don't trust you <br>
                            but we still share everything<br>
                            <br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            when i text you<br>
                            i make up what i wanted in my head<br>
                            i wonder if it could have worked<br>
                            i wonder what i could have said<br>
                            but then i see you and remember<br>
                            it's not meant to be<br>
                            you're just a little immature<br>
                            and i've got a couple things that's wrong with me<br>
                            <br>
                            but i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            i don't know where it goes from here<br>
                            don't know how we can keep this up<br>
                            what happens when you get a girl?<br>
                            what happens when you fall in love?<br>
                            will i be jealous?<br>
                            of what i could have had<br>
                            idealize the past <br>
                            like i'm a victim of my own circumstance<br>
                            <br>
                            and when you one day cut me off<br>
                            cause you're too busy living life<br>
                            i hope you find your answers out there<br>
                            and i know i will survive<br>
                            but i'm so grateful that we met<br>
                            and i still don't regret a thing<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            but i only want to mindfuck! can't you see?<br>
                            <br>
                            but i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that<br>
                            i wish i wanted you like that

                            This is the post-breakup but we're still friends (???) and what does that mean
                            (?????)
                            and
                            is that okay (???????) song. I was really asking a lot making Elliot play drums at
                            180
                            BPM
                            for 3 minutes but HE DID IT of course, and, in the end, we really captured
                            the
                            mania
                            of anxious avoidant attachment.

                            cover your face you're insecure<br>
                            just a minute, do you want to go outside?<br>
                            <br>
                            you shouldn't have to wait you're whole life<br>
                            but you kind of do<br>
                            no i can't make the feelings go away<br>
                            but know i'm here for you<br>
                            <br>

                            I started writing this one after a friend broke down in front of me when talking
                            about
                            his
                            relationship struggles, and he just looked so beautiful with tears in his eyes.
                            After
                            this,
                            I realized that crying with people is one of my favourite kinds of bonding (take
                            that as
                            you
                            will) because it's so vulnerable that it means you really trust each other.

                            I read a lot of psychology and self development books, and I always highlight all
                            these
                            new
                            life-changing insights while reading, and I write them down to remind myself after
                            and I
                            really think I will be different this time, and then they slowly fade away as I go
                            about
                            my
                            life or read the next one, and I am exactly the same. Against my best efforts,
                            history
                            repeats itself, and I found
                            myself in another relationship with someone who wasn't right for me and it was
                            completely my
                            responsibility. This is a very anxious attachment song, where I feel like I can't
                            keep
                            anything (idea, thought, identity, or person) too close, because everything fades
                            away.

                            Elliot and I call this the “Fake Lover” of this album. After breaking up with
                            someone I
                            got
                            to know very deeply, very quickly, everything I said to meet new people started to
                            feel
                            so
                            canned, like I had my script of facts and issues about me. I was wondering if it
                            would
                            ever
                            feel exciting to meet someone new and have them get to know me again, or if it would
                            just be
                            checking off a list now that I'd done it once. Then I wrote this song in like 15
                            minutes
                            after a guy I had liked (Just Another Lonely Girl boy) made me feel things OVER
                            EMAIL
                            and I
                            was like okay none of this is fair, what the fuck? It was fun to contrast the
                            delusional
                            brattiness and deep longing of breaking up in one song.

                            you can't keep this alive <br>
                            life is watching moments die<br>
                            <br>
                            but it was warm back in your sun<br>
                            i wouldn't trade what we had for anyone<br>
                            <br>
                            i'm counting days again<br>
                            a mark inside my head<br>
                            a road i just don't know yet<br>
                            i knew it was a dream<br>
                            it never lasts for me<br>
                            but i'm good at pretending<br>
                            <br>
                            if no one witnesses the world<br>
                            is it worth keeping?<br>
                            if i don't think about you<br>
                            will you leave me?<br>
                            <br>
                            do i keep myself so busy<br>
                            cause i don't want to know what's going on on the outside?<br>
                            what's going on on the outside?<br>
                            i don't know<br>
                            <br>
                            do beautiful things make anyone else sad?<br>
                            cause you can't enjoy it justice<br>
                            one minute i'm crying for the sunset<br>
                            then it's gone<br>
                            <br>
                            try to keep it it gets flattened<br>
                            suffocated in a box<br>
                            you can't keep this alive <br>
                            living in the moment while it dies<br>
                            <br>
                            but it was warm back in your sun<br>
                            somewhere in my memory there was love<br>
                            <br>
                            if no one witnesses the world<br>
                            is it worth keeping?<br>
                            if i forget about you<br>
                            were you real?

                        <p class="about-lyrics">
                            This one is about impermenance. I wrote it during a gorgeous sunset in January when
                            the
                            whole sky was pink and purple, and the first thing I felt was sadness that it would
                            soon
                            be
                            over. I've been working an internship for over a year, and it's been the best time
                            of my
                            life. As returning to university comes closer and closer to being a reality, I've
                            just
                            felt
                            this dread at how much I am going to lose, and how I have to go back to the living
                            hell
                            that
                            I made my previous university experience. While working, I've built so many
                            relationships,
                            I've had friends for the first time in years, and I've experienced so many new
                            things
                            with
                            them, I dated for the first time, I started chronically reading psychology and self
                            development books, I started actually recording the songs I wrote in secret for
                            years, I
                            fell in love with public transit and became super comfortable downtown, I tried so
                            many
                            things I had been scared of, I moved out(?!). My world has gotten so much bigger
                            than it
                            was
                            when I was a reclusive, depresed, anorexic university student whose only joy in life
                            was
                            obsessively cleaning my room, cooking dinner, and finishing assignments. The people I
                            met
                            through work reminded me how to be happy, and more fundamentally, how to be a person
                            in
                            the
                            world. That's what It's Never Enough was about, and I've grown so much since then,
                            but
                            I'm
                            also still the same person who feels separate from the world until someone else
                            pulls me
                            in.
                            How do you enjoy the moment when you know the warmth you have now can be gone in an
                            instant,
                            and you'll be back to the cold, dark, empty world you once lived in?

                        <p class="about-album">
                            This album (written between August 2023 and January 2024 and recorded from
                            December 2023
                            to
                            July
                            2024) is about reality, whereas most of the last one (It’s Never Enough) was
                            about
                            fantasy.
                            It
                            is the result of being pulled into somebody else's world, which is fun and
                            exciting and
                            overwhelming and scary and uncertain and sometimes doesn't work out. This
                            how I dealt
                            with
                            that.<br><br>
                            These songs are a snapshot of me learning to live with that uncertainty,
                            vulnerability,
                            and
                            impermanence, and actually enjoy them. At the end of the day, I want to feel
                            something
                            different, because it gives me
                            something to explore with lyrics and music, my absolute favourite thing in
                            the world.
                            I've
                            realized my life is nothing but cycles of experience and expression and I
                            have little
                            choice
                            in the matter.<br><br>
                            I wanted Anxious Avoidant to have a slightly heavier sound, because we're
                            all adults
                            now.
                            Biggest
                            thanks in the world to Elliot for
                            absolutely slaughtering every chord strum, piano hit and drum track. We
                            usually loop the
                            guitar
                            backing, and then record the rest
                            as one track through the whole song, which is insane when you're playing
                            drums at 180BPM
                            or
                            guitar soloing or or or. I do some the vocal tracks as one take but honestly
                            most of our
                            songs
                            have like 100 stems and 50 of them are background vocal layering.

                            I’m glad this, our second album, is finally out because I’m already done
                            writing the
                            next
                            one
                            (it’s called sex,
                            drugs, and open mindedness LMAO) and halfway through the next (tentatively
                            called
                            citygirl).
                            These songs are close to my heart, but I am happy to let them go because
                            it's been so
                            long,
                            they
                            don't really feel like mine anymore.
                            <br><br>
                            Until next time (hopefully soon),<br>

                            You know the set by now.

                            I (Olivia) write the songs on guitar (usually on my pink Jazzmaster,
                            Merona), and make a
                            dionysian
                            demo on Reaper that’s relatively in time.

                            Then Elliot (the band) and I work together to remake the song, using his
                            technical
                            expertise
                            to
                            add
                            more musical variety and flavour than my campfire chords can offer.

                            And then we lose our minds listening to it, amazed that we made another
                            banger.
