                                I wrote this one about my relationship with my mom, but sung it months later in a fever
                                dream minute when I was like "should I get back together with my ex?" (NO). Elliot says
                                it
                                sounds
                                like a 2000s teen movie credits song, which I consider a proud achievement.
                                <br><br> It starts
                                the album because it encapsulates the album's themes of connection, longing, and mania,
                                plus it straight up bangs.

                                Elliot once called this one a 'platonic lovesong' and I was like damn that is completely
                                right. It's about
                                the
                                most
                                outgoing, welcoming, extrovert's extrovert I have ever met, and how much I
                                appreciate
                                him
                                for always pulling me in.<br><br>
                                I am the kind of introvert (?) that needs like an hour of free alone time a day,
                                but otherwise wants to be surrounded by people constantly, so I always really appreciate
                                the work that extroverts do to draw us quiet ones out.

                            This is a cover of Desire, one of my favourite songs from legendary band, and
                            masters of
                            reverb, Cannons. A mix of their songs autoplayed on YouTube after some Metric songs
                            while I
                            was at work, and from the first song, let me tell you, I was TRANSFIXED. I remember
                            just
                            walking around downtown listening to the rest of the mix before going home like
                            “WOW”,
                            esentially with my mouth agape.
                            <br><br>
                            I tried playing Desire on guitar and just played it
                            heavier
                            and heavier until I was screaming. I recorded the demo in an hour maybe and brought
                            it to
                            Elliot immediately to record. It was lightning in a bottle and a welcome diversion from
                            "It's not fair" which we had been working on for months.
                            <br><br>
                            From a singer perspective, this was an experiment in
                            'sounding
                            sexy,' because the lyrics are more forward than I am comfortable being or writing. I
                            didn't
                            anticipate doing covers since I always have so much to write, but it's fun to
                            inhabit a
                            different persona and make it your own, which I think we more than achieved.
                            <br><br>
                            Seriously, listen to the original to compare (or just stop there since it's a
                            masterpiece).
                            Cannons captures the subtle push and pull of attraction, and I think we nail the
                            anguish of
                            unrequited desire.

                            I could be sexy<br>
Just give me time<br>
You've listened to all the songs I like<br>
<br>
I could be trusting<br>
Just give me space<br>
But don't leave when I expect you to stay<br>
<br>
I could be pretty<br>
I could dress up<br>
Make myself into your dream girl<br>
<br>
I could be something<br>
You could be too<br>
As soon as I'm over my issues<br>
<br>
But I'm too scared to touch you now<br>
I don't want to stand out<br>
Will you wake up<br>
I'm not good enough?<br>
Is it settling?<br>
Wasn't looking for you<br>
But damn you're something<br>
<br>
Cause I can't remember life before<br>
You asked me why and why again<br>
I don't like wasting time<br>
But with you I wish the days would never end<br>
<br>
Gotta sit down<br>
For the texts I sent<br>
You're just crazy enough<br>
To kind of get it<br>
In the front of my mind<br>
What if you're not right?<br>
But the worse thought<br>
Is what if you are?<br>
<br>
I could be cool<br>
I could be fun<br>
Show me off like a prize that you won<br>
<br>
I could be romantic<br>
Pull you into the rain<br>
Not feel sick when I'm kissing your face<br>
<br>
I could be lasting<br>
I could be fire<br>
As soon as I'm not an honest liar<br>
<br>
I could be happy<br>
I could fall in love<br>
As soon as I stop thinking so much<br>
<br>
But I don't want to tell my friends<br>
Don't want you to meet my parents<br>
Cause this is outside of me<br>
She's a new person I've never been<br>
A beginner with you<br>
<br>
Why is feeling seen so embarrassing?<br>
Look at you, I'm already ashamed<br>
Cause what if you saw what I thought?<br>
But you already know me like I'm see through<br>
<br>
And I tried<br>
To cut you off, here we are<br>
Sitting beside you entertaining this<br>
Cause I like how it feels to hold hands<br>
I like how it feels to casually touch you<br>
I like how you make the plans<br>
I like how you text me back<br>
I like how you think my thoughts<br>
I like how it feels to be wanted<br>
Wish I liked how it feels to want<br>
<br>
I can't let go yet<br>
know I overthought<br>
It's just that you're not what I thought I would want<br>
<br>
Hold on a bit longer<br>
Can we just pretend?<br>
Look the other way<br>
While delaying the end<br>

                            This song is essentially the thesis statement of the album: I want to be close
                            to people, but I am also afraid of being close to people and I don't know how. I wrote this
                            one after becoming a 'girlfriend' and realizing I had no idea how to do that.

                            It's the moment you realize the thing that's blocking you is you.

                            This is The Breakup Song. I wrote it in my head over a weekend trip to Mayne Island with
                            Elliot, which we spent just walking around and talking for like 10 hours a day.
                            <br><br>
                            Then I came home, wrote the song down, sung it
                            with
                            my
                            guitar, and realized I had to break up with my boyfriend. You can lie to your friends,
                            family, and yourself, but you can't lie to your
                            guitar.
                            <br><br>
                            It's basically my version of Thank U, Next. Gratefully moving on.

                            Cause everything else would be perfect<br>
                            But you can't change who you attract<br>
                            I wish I wanted it like you did<br>
                            <br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            When I imagine how we could be<br>
                            We'd move out and talk all night<br>
                            You'd make millions, I'd be happy<br>
                            <br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            So now we text every day<br>
                            More than we did when we were dating<br>
                            But it's no pressure if you don't<br>
                            And now I don't have to fulfill you<br>
                            <br>
                            Much better for my anxious avoidance<br>
                            Still don't trust you<br>
                            But we still share everything<br>
                            <br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            When I text you<br>
                            I make up what I wanted in my head<br>
                            I wonder if it could have worked<br>
                            I wonder what I could have said<br>
                            But then I see you and remember<br>
                            It's not meant to be<br>
                            You're just a little immature<br>
                            And I've got a couple things that's wrong with me<br>
                            <br>
                            But I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            <br>
                            I don't know where it goes from here<br>
                            Don't know how we can keep this up<br>
                            What happens when you get a girl?<br>
                            What happens when you fall in love?<br>
                            Will I be jealous?<br>
                            Of what I could have had<br>
                            Idealize the past<br>
                            Like I'm a victim of my own circumstance<br>
                            <br>
                            And when you one day cut me off<br>
                            Cause you're too busy living life<br>
                            I hope you find your answers out there<br>
                            And I know I will survive<br>
                            But I'm so grateful that we met<br>
                            And I still don't regret a thing<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            But I only want to mindfuck! Can't you see?<br>
                            <br>
                            But I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that<br>
                            I wish I wanted you like that

                            This is the post-breakup but we're still friends (???) and what does that mean
                            (?????)
                            and
                            is that okay (???????) song. Again, the mania of anxious avoidant attachment.
                            <br><br>
                            I was really asking a lot making Elliot play drums at
                            180
                            BPM
                            for 3 minutes but HE DID IT of course. Did I mention I am the luckiest ever to have such a
                            renaissance session musician at my disposal?
                            <br><br>
                            Sometimes I wonder if I'm being too honest in my music...
                            Anyways.

                            I started writing this one after a friend broke down in front of me while sharing
                            some personal issues, and I thought they looked kind of beautiful with tears in their eyes.
                            (Again, the honesty thing...)
                            <br><br>
                            After
                            this,
                            I realized that crying with people is one of my favourite kinds of bonding (take
                            that as
                            you
                            will) because it's so vulnerable that it means you really trust each other. Like seeing soul
                            to soul.

You don't know me<br>
You just saw me<br>
Way back last week<br>
Who was she?<br>
I couldn't tell you<br>
I've forgotten<br>
Wasn't lying when I said my<br>
Memory's always failing me<br>
Too many epiphanies<br>
<br>
But it never stays with me<br>
It never stays with me<br>
It never stays with me<br>
It never stays with me<br>
<br>
They never stay with me<br>
They never stay with me<br>
They never stay with me<br>
They never stay with me<br>
<br>
They never stay with me

                            I read a lot of psychology and self development books, and I always highlight all
                            these
                            new
                            life-changing insights while reading, and I write them down to remind myself after
                            and I
                            really think I will be different this time, and then they slowly fade away as I go
                            about
                            my
                            life or read the next one, and I am exactly the same.

                            Against my best efforts,
                            history
                            repeats itself, and I found
                            myself in another relationship with someone who I knew wasn't right for me and it was
                            completely my
                            responsibility.

                            This is a very anxious attachment song, where I feel like I can't
                            keep
                            anything (idea, thought, identity, or person) too close, because it all fades
                            away.

                            It's literally one track of me playing guitar and singing at the same time, which was
                            supposed to be a demo, but the subject matter is so vulnerable that adding anything else
                            felt disingenuous. Sometimes all you have is yourself.

                            I would call "It's not fair" the spiritual successor to “Fake Lover." After breaking up with
                            someone I
                            got
                            to know very deeply, very quickly, everything I said to meet new people started to
                            feel
                            so
                            canned, like I had my script of facts and issues about me. I was wondering if it
                            would
                            ever
                            feel exciting to meet someone new and have them get to know me again, or if it would
                            just be
                            checking off a list now that I'd done it once.
                            <br><br>
                            Then I wrote this song in like 15
                            minutes
                            after a guy I had liked (Just Another Lonely Girl boy) made me feel things OVER
                            EMAIL
                            and I
                            was like okay none of this is fair, what the fuck?
                            <br><br>
                            It was fun to contrast the
                            delusional
                            brattiness and deep longing of breaking up in one song. Turns out brattiness is much more
                            embarrassing.
                            <br><br>
                            This one also took the longest. We started working on it in January 2024, and it was one of
                            the
                            last songs we finished in August 2024. Much like Halflife on our first album, it just
                            refused to be in time. No matter how many times we redid tracks, they still felt off, so we
                            would keep shelving it to work on other songs. Finally, we had to finish the album, so went
                            back to it, but this time it had been so long that I wasn't feeling this way anymore. That's
                            where the (over it) version came from: we both just weren't feeling that angsty anymore, so
                            we made this
                            happy jazzy version of the song.
                            <br><br>
                            It's not fair is denial and (over it) is acceptance. We decided to put it at the end of the
                            album so it ended on a somewhat positive note. A reminder that no matter how lost or
                            sad you feel now,
                            one day it'll just be another good memory.

                            This one is about impermenance. I wrote it during a gorgeous sunset in January when
                            the
                            whole sky was pink and purple, and the first thing I felt was sadness that it would
                            soon
                            be
                            over. I've been working an internship for over a year, and it's been the best time
                            of my
                            life. As returning to university comes closer and closer to being a reality, I've
                            just
                            felt
                            this dread at how much I am going to lose, and how I have to go back to the living
                            hell
                            that
                            I made my previous university experience.
                            <br><br>
                            While working, I've built so many
                            relationships,
                            I've had friends for the first time in years, and I've experienced so many new
                            things
                            with
                            them, I dated for the first time, I started chronically reading psychology and self
                            development books, I started actually recording the songs I wrote in secret for
                            years, I
                            fell in love with public transit and became super comfortable downtown, I tried so
                            many
                            things I had been scared of, I moved out(?!). My world has gotten so much bigger
                            than it
                            was
                            when I was a reclusive, depresed, anorexic university student whose only joy in life
                            was
                            obsessively cleaning my room, cooking dinner, and doing well on assignments. Now it feels like I
                            feel like I lost three years of my life to that with not much to show for it.
                            <br><br>
                            The people I
                            met
                            through work reminded me how to be happy, and more fundamentally, how to be a person
                            in
                            the
                            world. That's what It's Never Enough was about, and I've grown so much since then,
                            but
                            I'm
                            also still the same person who feels separate from the world until someone else
                            pulls me
                            in.
                            How do you enjoy the moment when you know the warmth you have now can be gone in an
                            instant,
                            and you'll be back to the cold, empty world you once lived in? I can't go back to how life was before.
                            <br><br>
                            I really struggled to name this one, it was originally going to be 'Were you real?' and then
                            'Real' but I didn't like either. When I was submitting the tracks to LANDR (the distribution
                            service we use), it suddenly clicked that I should name it this, the name of another song I
                            had been working on but couldn't get right in time for this album release. Safe in my memory
                            gives it a little silver lining that when something is gone, it's just safe, forever, in
                            your memory.

                        <p class="about-album">
                            This album (written between August 2023 and January 2024 and recorded from
                            December 2023
                            to
                            July
                            2024) is about reality, whereas most of the last one (It’s Never Enough) was
                            about
                            fantasy.
                            <br><br>
                            It
                            is the result of being pulled into somebody else's world, which is fun and
                            exciting and
                            overwhelming and scary and uncertain and sometimes doesn't work out. This
                            how I dealt
                            with
                            that.<br><br>
                            These songs are a snapshot of me learning to live with that vulnerability,
                            and
                            impermanence, and actually enjoy them. At the end of the day, I want to feel
                            something
                            different, because it gives me
                            something to explore with lyrics and music, my absolute favourite thing in
                            the world.
                            Life's just cycles of experience and expression, it's not that deep.
                            <br><br>
                            I wanted Anxious Avoidant to have a slightly heavier sound, because we're
                            all adults
                            now. Since starting to work on this album, we've both grown up a lot (especially me). As
                            much as some of these songs feel so immature and emotional, at the end of the day,
                            authenticity is my core value as an artist. Honesty is what makes the songs interesting as a
                            snapshot in time. As much as I change, I hope I can always channel my unfiltered emotions
                            and feelings into music regardless of how it makes me look. I mean, I called the album
                            Anxious Avoidant, at least I'm self aware (although I don't think that label is even true
                            anymore).
                            <br><br>
                            Biggest
                            thanks in the world to Elliot for
                            absolutely slaughtering every chord strum, piano hit and drum track. We
                            usually loop the
                            guitar
                            backing, and then record the rest
                            as one track through the whole song, which is insane when you're playing
                            drums at 180BPM
                            or
                            guitar soloing or or or. I do some the vocal tracks as one take but honestly
                            most of our
                            songs
                            have like 100 stems and 50 of them are background vocal layering.

                            I’m glad this, our second album, is finally out because I’m already done
                            writing the
                            next
                            one
                            (it’s called sex,
                            drugs, and open mindedness LMAO) and halfway through the next (tentatively
                            called
                            citygirl).
                            These songs are close to my heart, but I am happy to let them go because
                            it's been so
                            long,
                            they
                            don't really feel like mine anymore.
                            <br><br>

                            You know the set by now.

                            I (Olivia) write the songs on guitar (usually on my pink Jazzmaster,
                            Merona), and make a
                            dionysian
                            demo on Reaper that’s relatively in time.

                            Then Elliot (the band) and I work together to remake the song, using his
                            technical
                            expertise
                            to
                            add
                            more musical variety and flavour than my campfire chords can offer.

                            And then we lose our minds listening to it, amazed that we made another
                            banger.
