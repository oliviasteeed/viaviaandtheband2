                        <br>

                        but don't leave when i expect you to stay<br>
                        <br>
                        i could be pretty<br>
                        i could dress up<br>
                        make myself into your dream girl<br>
                        <br>
                        i could be something<br>
                        you could be too<br>
                        as soon as i'm over my issues<br>
                        <br>
                        but i'm too scared to touch you now<br>
                        i don't want to stand out<br>
                        will you wake up<br>
                        i'm not good enough<br>
                        is it settling?<br>
                        wasn't looking for you<br>
                        but damn you're something<br>
                        <br>
                        cause i can't remember life before<br>
                        you asked me why and why again<br>
                        i don't like wasting time<br>
                        but with you i wish the days would never end<br>
                        <br>
                        gotta sit down<br>
                        for the texts i sent<br>
                        you're just crazy enough<br>
                        to kind of get it<br>
                        in the front of my mind<br>
                        what if you're not right <br>
                        but the worse thought<br>
                        is what if you are?<br>
                        <br>
                        i could be cool<br>
                        i could be fun<br>
                        show me off like a prize that you won<br>
                        <br>
                        i could be romantic<br>
                        pull you into the rain<br>
                        not feel sick when i'm kissing your face<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="song-lyrics">
                        i could be lasting<br>
                        i could be fire<br>
                        as soon as i'm not an honest liar<br>
                        <br>
                        i could be happy<br>
                        i could fall in love<br>
                        as soon as i stop thinking so much <br>
                        <br>
                        but i don't want to tell my friends<br>
                        don't want you to meet my parents<br>
                        cause this is outside of me<br>
                        she's a new person i've never been<br>
                        a beginner with you<br>
                        <br>
                        feeling seen is so embarassing<br>
                        look at you i'm already ashamed<br>
                        cause what if you saw what i thought?<br>
                        but you already know me like i'm see through<br>
                        <br>
                        already tried <br>
                        to cut you off, here we are<br>
                        sitting beside you entertaining this<br>
                        cause i like how it feels to hold hands<br>
                        i like how it feels to casually touch you<br>
                        i like how you make the plans<br>
                        i like how you text me back<br>
                        i like how you think my thoughts<br>
                        i like how it feels to be wanted <br>
                        wish i liked how it feels to want <br>
                        <br>
                        i can't let go yet <br>
                        know i overthought <br>
                        it's just that you're not what i thought i would want<br>
                        <br>
                        hold on a bit longer<br>
                        can we just pretend?<br>
                        look the other way<br>
                        while delaying the end

                        when you pick me to talk to<br>

                        you're really not special<br>
                        you only ask questions<br>
                        and start conversations<br>
                        and make my life better<br>
                        <br>
                        you make it look easy<br>
                        you make it look easy<br>
                        you make it look easy<br>
                        but i know it isn't<br>

                        wake up at 3 just to text back to you<br>
                        cause there's so much to talk about<br>
                        two whole lives of pretentious opinions<br>
                        <br>
                        you're so different, i disagree<br>
                        but i like when you challenge me<br>
                        you bring something to the table<br>
                        you can match my energy<br>
                        <br>

                        you weren't good enough for me<br>

                        we say it's surreal<br>

                        innocent youth<br>
                        i think i'm a little old for you<br>
                        <br>

                        with a word on your tongue<br>
                        but i don't want you to say it<br>
                        cause you're not the one<br>

                        i've never met someone like you<br>
                        i like that you tell me all your secrets<br>
                        but after you read me your old notes<br>
                        i kind of wish i stayed ignorant<br>
                        <br>
                        and you want all the answers too<br>
                        but aside from thoughts do you actually feel it? <br>
                        you're out turning your life into business<br>
                        and i belong to the world you rejected<br>
                        <br>
                        in the start i was naive<br>

                        much better for my anxious avoidance<br>

                        it's not meant to be<br>

                        but you kind of do<br>
                        no i can't make the feelings go away<br>
                        but know i'm here for you<br>
                        i'm here for you<br>

                        nobody's ever as beautiful<br>
                        as they are telling secrets<br>
                        my favourite people<br>
                        are embarrassed<br>
                        <br>
                        and if you think this changes anything<br>
                        well think again<br>
                        new words don't change the core i see to<br>
                        <br>
                        you've got tense hands been there before<br>
                        red tired eyes i recognize<br>
                        cover your face you're insecure<br>
                        just a minute, do you want to go outside<br>

                        This album (written between August 2023 and January 2024 and recorded from December 2023 to July
                        2024) is about reality, whereas most of the last one (It’s Never Enough) was about fantasy. It
                        is the result of being pulled into somebody else's world, which is fun and exciting and
                        overwhelming and scary and uncertain and sometimes doesn't work out. This how I dealt with
                        that.<br><br>
                        These songs are a snapshot of me learning to live with that uncertainty, vulnerability, and
                        impermanence, and actually enjoy them. I want to feel something different, because it gives me
                        something to explore with lyrics and music, my absolute favourite thing in the world. I've
                        realized my life is nothing but cycles of experience and expression and I really have no choice
                        in the matter.<br><br>
                        I wanted Anxious Avoidant to have a more heavy sound, because we're all adults now. To me, AA
                        feels like INE's big sister and I love that. Biggest thanks in the world to Elliot for
                        absolutely slaughtering every chord strum, piano hit and drum beat. He does most of the tracks
                        in one take, which is insane when you're playing at 180BPM, for example (like on Mindfuck!).
                        <br><br>
                        I’m glad this, our second album, is finally out because I’m already done writing the next one
                        (it’s called sex,
                        drugs, and open mindedness LMAO) and halfway through the next (tentatively called citygirl). I
                        just have a lot to say apparently.<br><br>
                        Until next time (hopefully soon),<br>

                        You know the set by now.

                        I (Olivia) write the songs on guitar (usually on my pink Jazzmaster, Merona), and make a
                        dionysian
                        demo on Reaper that’s relatively in time.

                        Then Elliot (the band) and I work together to remake the song, using his technical expertise to
                        add
                        more musical variety and flavour than my campfire chords can offer.

                        And then we lose our minds listening to it, amazed that we made another banger.
